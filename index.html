        The Commonwealth Games, often known as the Friendly Games, are an international multisport competition held every four years for athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations. 
        With the exception of 1942 and 1946 (which were postponed because of World War II), 
        the event has been staged every four years since it debuted in 1930.  From 1930 to 1950, the events were known as the British Empire Games, from 1954 to 1966 as the 
        British Empire and Commonwealth Games, and from 1970 to 1974 as the British Commonwealth Games. Since 2002, athletes with disabilities have been accepted as full members of their country teams,
         making the Commonwealth Games the first international multisport competition to be completely inclusive.
         The Games made history in 2018 when they had an equal number of medal events for men and women, and they made history again four years later when they featured more women's events than men's events. 

         Melville Marks Robinson established the British Empire Games, which were first staged in Hamilton, Canada, in 1930, after being inspired by the Inter-Empire Championships, a component of the 1911 Festival of Empire.
         
          The Commonwealth Paraplegic Games for athletes with disabilities (who were prohibited from competing from 1974 until they were completely integrated by 1990)
          and the Commonwealth Youth Games for athletes between the ages of 14 and 18 were added as the Games developed over time.

    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>John Astley Cooper first proposed a sporting event that would unite the British Empire's nations in 1891. He suggested a 
        "Pan Brittanic, Pan Anglican Contest every four years as a means of increasing goodwill and understanding of the British Empire" 
        in letters and articles for a number of periodicals. In order to forward the concept, John Astley Cooper Committees were established
         in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Pierre de Coubertin was the inspiration for the drive to create an international 
         Olympic Games.

        The Earl of Plymouth and Lord Desborough supported the 1911 Inter-Empire Championship, which was held in conjunction with the Festival of Empire at The Crystal Palace in London to commemorate George V's coronation.

        <h2>CEREMONIES</h2>
        <hr>
        <h4>0PENING</h4>
        <p>The Commonwealth Games' opening ceremony is framed by a number of factors. This ritual occurs in advance of the actual activities.
             The national anthem of the hosting nation is usually performed before the hoisting of its flag. During the opening ceremony, 
             the flags of the Commonwealth Games Federation, the previous host country, and the following host country are also displayed. 
             The guest country then performs artistic performances of music, singing, dancing, and theatre that reflect its culture. The 
             creative presentations have gotten bigger and more complicated as new hosts try to make the ceremony more memorable than the one
              before it.
             According to reports, the Delhi Games' opening ceremony cost $70 million, with a large portion of the expense going into the 
             aesthetic</p>
             <h4>CLOSING</h4>
             <p>Following the conclusion of all competitions, the Commonwealth Games' closing ceremony is held. The athletes enter the stadium 
                collectively without any national distinction after the flag bearers from each participating nation. The closing remarks are delivered 
                by the CGF president and the president of the organising committee, and the Games are then declared to be over. The CGF president also 
                discusses how the competitions are run. The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) flag is handed over from the mayor of the host city to 
                the CGF president, who then gives it to the mayor of the city hosting the following Commonwealth Games. The following host country then
                 gives a succinct introduction to itself through creative performances of dance and theatre that reflect its culture.
                 many talented musicians and artists</p>
